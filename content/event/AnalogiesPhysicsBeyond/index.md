#summary: Conference – “Analogies in Physics and Beyond”
abstract: 'Analogies in physics and beyond will examine the circulation of models within and across the sciences. Leading contemporary epistemologists will analyse the process of exchanging scientific knowledge from one field to another, detailing the challenges that often stand in the way of such transfers, as well as the opportunities that emerge from current research. The overarching aim is to dig deeper into the creative side of scientific thinking while tackling the philosophical questions that successful exchanges raise.


The first day of the conference will be devoted to case studies in contemporary physics, with talks on symmetry-breaking, quantum mechanics and black hole thermodynamics. The second day will move past physics to discuss relevant examples of analogies in biology, economics, robotics and AI. For its theme and ambition, the conference aims to be useful not only to specialists in epistemology but also to scientists and educators interested in the cognitive and social foundations of scientific research.'
