I am currently a postdoc at Polimi in the Mathematics Department. I work on the PRIN project ‘Analogical Reasoning in Contemporary Physical Theories’. I studied Physics at the University of Mons (Belgium) before turning to the philosophy of science. I obtained a PhD at Mons in partnership with the University of Namur. I am particularly interested in epistemology of models, scientific realism and philosophy of physics. My work now focuses on physical analogies and the link between analogical reasoning and scientific explanation.
